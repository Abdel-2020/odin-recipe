      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Mille-feuille, also known as Napoleon, is a classic French pastry made
        of layers of crisp puff pastry alternated with rich pastry cream, and
        often topped with powdered sugar or glazed icing. Its delicate, flaky
        texture and creamy filling make it a timeless dessert favorite.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking
            sheet with a silicone mat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Separate dough at the seams into 4 squares and place on the prepared
            baking sheet. Prick dough all over with the tines of a fork. Lightly
            sprinkle with sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover with 1 sheet parchment paper, then 3 sheets aluminum foil.
            Nest another baking sheet on top to apply pressure to dough while it
            bakes
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the top baking
            sheet and foil; gently peel off parchment paper. Continue baking
            until pastry is browned, 10 to 15 minutes. (Alternatively, you can
            bake about 7 minutes after uncovering, flip sheets over, and bake
            until brown on the other side, about 7 more minutes.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely before cutting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a sharp serrated knife with a light sawing motion to square
            sheets by trimming uneven edges. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 3
            equal rectangles. Use 3 rectangles per pastry.
          </li>
